Hi, my name is Alex. I'm from Ecuador, I was born and raised in its capital city Quito, where I live in. I been working with data from the very first moment I got my engineering degree in Economic and Financial Sciences from National Polythecnic School (EPN). I have worked along side many public institutions from my country as a consultant. I got my own brewery called Zizek, now in stand by. 

I'm personally interested in how data can make a difference in public policy desgin. The most recent work was at the Social Lab, an iniciative from Vital Strategies and the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) which has three porpuses: create quality information based on administratives records, make analysis and proposals of public policies with this information, and latly but not less important: share the information with the public.
